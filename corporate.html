		  </ul>
          <p>The font styles Josefin Sans Bold and Mulish are ideal for the Unbeak brand. A contemporary, geometric
            sans-serif font named Josefin Sans Bold symbolizes the balance that Unbeak stands for. Mulish is a warm and
            inviting script typeface that emphasizes equanimity and vulnerability, which is a theme of Unbeak. Combined,
            the two fonts produce a balance between classic and contemporary lettering that perfectly captures the
            essence of the Unbeak brand</p>

        <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
        <p>To test our website we did one round of testing. This round included 3 partcipants who were given a number of questions and tasks. <strong>Testing evidence can be found in the appendix at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>
        <h5>Questions & Tasks</h5>
		<ul>
			<li> Try to donate to Unbeak</li>
			<li> Try to find our vison and our values </li> 
			<li>Try to find our privacy policy</li>
			<li>What do you think of the colors used?</li>
			<li>Is the layout appealing to you?</li>
			<li>Does the design of the website help persuade you into funding this brand?</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Test Results</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Our test participants had no trouble finding the option to donate. Putting it that big on the home page worked out really well.</li>
			<li>Finding our vision and values was also very easy. One participant went to the visual identity page first, because she associated the word ‘brand value’ with identity.</li>
			<li>Finding our privacy took a bit longer because our participants had to scroll down to the footer to find it but nobody clicked on the wrong thing.</li>
			<li>We received very mixed feedback from our participants concerning our colors. All participants thought our colors were soft, bright, happy but not all participants felt intrigued by them or thought they fit the image of a tea company. Something we realized during testing is that our participants do noy link the visual identity to the brand, they link it to the product and type of product. This resulted in multiple test participants not liking the colors we used because it did not represent a style that they consider to be right for a tea company. </li>
			<li>When looking at our layout we only had one participant who thought there was too much text. All other participants were very pleased by the layout.<i>‘I like the layout of the website. My attention was immediately grabbed by the quote and the “HEY” on the first page. The website is easy to navigate. On your first page it becomes immediately clear to me what Unbeak is about. Without having to read a whole bookwork. The layout is also very consistent, which I like.’</i> This is what one of our test participants had to say about the layout.</li>
			<li>Overall our test participants were not convinced enough to invest/donate to Unbeak. This mostly had to do with the fact that they thought the brand felt too childish. We are trying to create a moment for parents to stop for a second and drink some tea, so some of our participants thought it should have a more adult look to target those parents.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Future Actions</h5>
		<p>We as Unbeak were very happy with our test results as all of our participants were able to find the needed information in time. We did realize that not everybody is a fan of our visual identity, but after long consideration we have decided to stick with what we have since we feel like the current identity connects very well with our values. For future action we are looking at actually creating the customization page because we haven’t done much with it (which was intentional) and that confused some of our participants. We also changed the amount of text on all pages and it has been significantly reduced based on feedback from one of our participants.</p>

        <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

        <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
		  <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Communication message and objectives</h4>
		  <p>Our current objectives are:</p>
          <p><strong>Reach:</strong> By the 10th of June, we want to reach 100 people to have seen our page on Instagram and 75 people to have seen our page on Facebook. </p>
        <p><strong>Affect:</strong> By the 10th of June 2023, we aim to create a campaign that promotes a sense of calm and balance in our target audience and maintains a community where followers can interact. To measure this, we want to achieve an average of 2 shared posts on both Instagram and Facebook. </p>
        <p class="mb-1"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
		<ul class="pb-3">
			<li>By the 10th of June 2023, we want to have 10 likes on average on every Instagram and Facebook post.  </li>
			<li>By the 10th of June 2023, we want to have an average of one comment on every Instagram and Facebook post.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="marketing-5">Target audience: Parents with young children</h4>
			<p>Our target audience is parents with young children located in the south of the Netherlands. Therefore, we have decided to specify to parents with children between the ages of two and eight years old. Understanding that raising children can be financially challenging and that most parents have part-time or full-time jobs to support their families, we took into account their busy schedules. From our problem interviews, we gathered that parents often struggle to find time for themselves due to raising their children while balancing their commitment to their career, and partner (in the case of married or partnered parents), or in finding a new partner (in the case of separated parents).</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>At What time is our target audience on social media?</strong></h6>
		 	<p>During our problem interviews, we observed that our target audience has limited phone usage during weekdays due to their busy schedule. Mornings are particularly occupied with getting their children ready and dropping them off at school and a significant portion of the audience is working during the day. When they finish work they Therefore, they only have free time in the evening after their kids have gone to bed, which is why we have decided to post our content at 19.00.</p>
		  	<p>On the weekend it is the opposite. People we interviewed said that they have time for themselves in the morning. While being occupied in the afternoon with playing and spending time with their children or have planned other activities. Based on this information, we have decided to post our content at 11.00 in the morning on Saturdays, which we believe strikes a good balance. </p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Which platforms are our target audience using, for how long, and what do we want to communicate?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>The interviewees stated that they are mostly on Facebook and Instagram between thirty minutes and 1,5 hours per day. This was not true to every interview as some of the interviewees stated that they did not use these apps at all or very little. 
			They reported scrolling through the apps until something catches their attention, often an unconventional image or vivid colors.
			As our brand message revolves around balance, equanimity, and vulnerability, we have carefully chosen colors that stand out while still staying true to our identity.</p>
		  	<p>Our color palette includes a light shade of blue, which promotes a calming effect on the viewer's mind. We have also opted for a warm yellow color to balance the blue, and orange to encourage social interaction and reflect the youthful spirit of Unbeak.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What is the activity on the app?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>When they were active on the app, they were focused on posts of people that they know. During our problem interviews, we found that some of our target audience members use Instagram and Facebook primarily to keep up with their loved ones. 
			Other interviewees also stated that they use the apps so that they can see aesthetically pleasing content. Meaning, fashion-related, online shopping, creative, and arts & crafts content. We also observed that "silly" content, such as memes and funny videos, is popular among our target group on Facebook.
			</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What brands does our target audience like?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>The brands they prefer vary per person. For instance, one interviewee expressed interest in fashion and followed brands like Zara, while others preferred larger corporations like Bol.com. Due to the these preferences within our interviewees being far apart from one and another we need to focus on our posting schedule, particularly in the evenings at 7 PM.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Persona reflection based on the road map</strong></h6>
		  	<img class="img-fluid pb-5" src="images/unbeakmarketing3.jpg" alt="Unbeak brand roadmap">
		  <div class="row">
		  	<img class="col-6 img-fluid" src="images/unbeakpersona_Pagina_1.png" alt="Unbeak persona">
			<img class="col-6 img-fluid" src="images/unbeakpersona_Pagina_2.png" alt="Unbeak persona">
			<p class="pt-2">Our persona is developed based on insights from our problem interviews, which highlighted the significant time constraints experienced by parents with young children. As a result, we aim to provide our audience with a moment of respite, enabling them to find the balance necessary to fulfill their responsibilities towards others.</p>
		  </div>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>How we are positioning our message.</strong></h6>
		  	<p>From our problem interviews we gathered that our target audience prefers to be approached in an informal way. Other reasons why we used informal communication are: </p>
		  <ol>
			  <li><strong>Relatability</strong>: An informal communication can help make our message more relatable to the target audience. By using everyday language, we can connect with our audience on a more personal level and create a sense of familiarity.</li>
			  <li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: An informal approach can also help to convey authenticity and honesty. Using a more conversational tone can help to make us seem more genuine and approachable, which can build trust with our audience.</li>
			  <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: An informal style of communication can make your message more accessible to a wider range of people. By using language that is easy to understand and avoiding complex jargon, we can make our message more inclusive and understandable to a wider audience.</li>
			  <li><strong>Engagement</strong>: An informal tone can help to keep our audience engaged and interested in our message. By using a conversational style, we can create better dynamic and interactive communication with them, which can help to hold our audience's attention.</li>
		  </ol>
		  	<p>How this looks in practice on our social media is by having a caption that has a meaning, is connected to our brand, and makes it relatable to our target audience.  </p>
		  	<img src="images/unbeakmarketing1.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="unbeak social media caption">
		  	<p class="pt-2">Example:<br>Caption is underneath the post of our tea flavor introduction. Here, we inform them about our flavors, give them the option to make their own tea, and remind them to check their email.  </p>
		  	<p>With this, we connect the audience in a sense that it is relatable and accessible. To make it authentic we created our own visuals and also created a mascot, Benny the Duck. He is a returning character in our posts. When they will see Benny, they will immediately think of Unbeak.</p>
		 <h4 id="marketing-6">Media tactics</h4>
		  	<p>Out of our problem interviews with our target audience, we noticed that our target audience is mainly positioned on Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, we have chosen to promote Unbeak on these platforms.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Why are we using Instagram?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>Instagram is a visual content-based platform that enables us to showcase our brand’s image and videos, fostering a social connection with our audience. As numerous brands and businesses have a strong presence on this platform, users can keep themselves informed about their preferred brands and come across new ones. Given our unique style, Instagram is a great avenue for users to discover our brand. One of the platform’s significant strengths is its robust algorithm that can assist users in discovering new content and accounts that they find relatable, allowing us to build our community. </p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Why are we using Facebook?</strong></h6>		  
		  	<p>Our target audience utilizes Facebook in order to remain updated on their social connections, engage in networking activities, and seek entertainment through various mediums such as news articles, videos, games, and research products or services. An evident advantage of Facebook is that it offers multiple appealing reasons for our audience to use the platform, as highlighted by our interviewees. Consequently, we have numerous avenues to effectively approach and establish our brand presence within the app. </p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What is our goal in promoting Unbeak? </strong></h6>
		  	<p>Our objectives encompass encouraging individuals to donate/invest in our cause, raising awareness about the significance of self-care, and fostering a supportive community that serves as a safe haven. </p>
		  	<p>We aim for people to contribute to our organization so that we can offer them herbal tea tailored to their system’s needs, helping them achieve relaxation, energy, or sleep. </p>
		  	<p>Through Unbeak, our primary focus is to advocate for the importance of self-care, particularly among parents with young children. Nevertheless, we aspire for widespread recognition of our brand, as our ultimate goal is to assist people in finding balance within their hectic routines.</p>
		  	<p>By imparting knowledge about self-care and prioritization, our intention is to establish a community that provides a secure and comforting environment. This enables us to cultivate a dedicated audience that closely follows our every undertake. </p>

		  	<img src="images/unbeakmarketing2.png" class="img-fluid marketing-planning" alt="unbeak social media shedule">
		  	<p>We created the accounts on Wednesday the 15th of March. Due to this, we started posting on a Wednesday.</p>
		  	<p class="mb-1">From our interviews. we gathered the following about time of posting:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>The time that our target audience is on our chosen platforms, on a weekday, is during the evenings, after dinner. This is why we post at 19.00 in the evening.</li>
			<li>We picked Tuesday and Thursday because we wanted to have a day between every post so that when people see our post, it stands out.  </li>
			<li>Our interviewees stated that they mostly have plans on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons & evenings. We wanted to avoid this time of the day, so we build around the target audience's general schedule. This is also why we post on Saturday mornings at 11.00.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p class="mb-1">Content being posted:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>On Tuesdays, we wanted to use these days to inform and introduce our brand to our potential audience.</li>
			<li>We decided to post our values every Thursday, but since we have three values and four weeks, we wanted to remind people to donate/invest. Since that is one of our main goals.</li>
			<li>On the weekend we want to promote our audience to rest from a busy week and remind them that it’s time for self-care. However, to go around the general target audience schedule.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p class="mb-1">Designer of the posts:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>To have some diversity in design and to divide the work, we chose to have two designers. Between the two of them, they divided who designed what, so that the workload is divided equally.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p>We stop our social media activities on the 10th of April so that we have time to reflect. To see what did work and what did not, to see if we have reached our objectives, and to see what our main learning points are.</p>

				<p>The picture on the left shows us insights about the reach of our Instagram profile between the period 9th of May 2023 and 10th of June 2023. Our objective was to reach 100 people within this time; however, we have reached 40 accounts, this is 60% less than our goal. It shows that we reached 37,9% more than over the period 6th of April until 8th of May. This information is negligible as we did not post during this time.</p>

				<p>The picture to the right shows us insights about the reach of our Facebook profile between the period 16th of May and the 12th of June. Unfortunately, it was not possible to look at the period 9th of May and 10th of June. Our objective was to reach 75 people before 10th of June. In total we reached 4 people, this is 94,67% less then our objective. Besides this it has to be taken into consideration that the 4 people that were reached are all our own team members. The reason why Facebook reached significantly less people than Instagram could be that all our team members and a large portion of the other students taking part in this project are not active on Facebook and therefore promoting the account failed. </p>

		  </section>
		  	<p>Both parts of our reach objective are not achieved. There are multiple possible reasons for how this could happen. As this is the redo and the initial campaign stopped at the 10th of April it is highly likely that we lost support from the other groups as this project is closed for them. This also counts for our interviewees that followed us, as they were told that the project ended on the 10th of April. Our interviewees all stated to not spend too much time on social media due to a lack of time and or interest and are therefore highly selective of the content they view. When we look at the activity that our interviewees thus our target audience has on Instagram and Facebook they state to mostly use it to keep up with loved once, Unbeak does not belong to this group. However, they also mention to love funny content. This is something we could have capitalized on. Another reason for not obtaining the objective could be that our content should have been better adjusted to the platform as each platform requires a different way to succeed due to a different target audience. It is recommended that research is done to know what works on which platform. </p>
		  <h5><strong>Response Objectives</strong></h5>
		  	<p>Our response objectives were “By the 10th of June 2023, we want to have 10 likes on average on every Instagram and Facebook post.” And “By the 10th of June 2023, we want to have an average of one comment on every Instagram and Facebook post.” In the next section we will analyze each post. For each post, the two left pictures are insights from Instagram and the right one shows insights from Facebook.</p>
			<p><strong>Post 1</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_3.png" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>On Instagram the first post of the redo media campaign got 6 likes, and 0 comments. On Facebook we had both 0 likes and 0 comments. This means that this post did not achieve our objectives. Besides the reasons discussed above in the reach objectives there are more possible explanations for not achieving the objective. As this is the first post after not posting for a month it is likely that we have lost followers and the ones that we still have are less invested in our content. On top of this the caption was rather short and the post did not share any relevant or engaging information. </p>
		  	<p><strong>Post 2</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_4.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>For this post we got 7 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and both 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. This means that we did not achieve our response objectives with this post. It is likely that this post did not achieve the objective due to the reasons stated in the reach objectives reflection. </p>
		  	<p><strong>Post 3</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_5.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>With this post we received 5 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and on Facebook we had 0 likes and 0 comments. Although we did not achieve our response objectives it is interesting to look at the reach of this post. 5 of the people we reached came from hashtags. The hashtags we used were #herbalhealing, #sipandsavor and #UnbeakLove. We keep this in mind for future recommendations.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 4</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_6.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>For this post we can share the same insights as the previous one. We had 5 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. Therefore, we did not achieve our response objective. Reasons for the low results of posts have already been shared in the reach objective. However, similar to the first post the caption was not as enthusing and did not share new information about the company. </p>
		  <p><strong>Post 5</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_7.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>For this post we had again, 5 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. However, besides this we also reached less people then in the posts before. Reasons specifically for this post could be making use of unpopular hashtags: #CraftyourBlend #UnbeakTeaCustomization and #EndlessPossibliTeas. Another reason could be that, against our expectations our target audience did not want to hear multiple announcements short after one and another about our customizing option. Within this post we tried to make use of a wordplay as our target audience mentioned to like funny content. Unfortunately, looking at our insights, this did not work.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 6</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_8.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>As our results stayed low for this post we tried a simple design to switch it up. However, the results were similar to the other posts as again on Instagram we received 5 likes and 0 comments and on Facebook we had 0 likes and 0 comments. We did not reach our objectives with this post.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 7</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_9.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>Although, we did not reach our objectives with this post it did get the most likes. On Instagram we received 8 likes and unfortunately still 0 comments and on Facebook we had 0 comments and 0 likes. We reached 11 people of which 0 trough hashtags or explore. The caption was rather short. Therefore, it is highly likely that our followers liked the use of a graphical illustration style showing our mascot benny. </p>
		  <p><strong>Post 8</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_10.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>This post, similar to the others received 5 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. Therefore, we did not reach our response objectives. However, for this post it is interesting that 7 of the people we reached followed one of the hashtags: #Unbeak #CustomBlend #TeaRevolution #BrewYourOwn #IndulgelnFlavor. We, again, keep this in mind for future recommendations.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 9</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_11.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>This post received 7 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. We did not reach our objective. The number of likes is slightly higher than others on Instagram and again 2 people were reached by hashtags.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 10</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_12.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>This post did not reach the objective as it received 6 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. Besides the general previously mentioned reasons other reasons could be that our target audience was not interested in the caption telling a fun fact about tea plants. However, there is not enough evidence yet to not do this again as the insights are similar to other posts.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 11</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_13.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>This post did not reach the objective as it received 6 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. However, this post does have the highest reach of all posts after 10th of April. Again, we see that a large part of this is due to the used hashtags: #Unbeak, #CustomBlend #TeaRevolution #BrewYourOwn #IndulgelnFlavor #LimitedTimeOffer. We keep this in mind for future recommendations.</p>
		  <p><strong>Post 12</strong></p>
			<img src="images/unbeakpr_14.jpg" alt="" class="pr-image pb-2">
			<p>The last post reached the least people and got the least likes, 4 likes and 0 comments on Instagram and same as all the other posts 0 likes and 0 comments on Facebook. Besides the reasons stated before for these posts it is likely that it was not successful as it was the last one to be posted and therefore had the least time to spread. Note that still 2 people were reached by hashtags.</p>
		  <h5><strong>Affect Objective</strong></h5>
		  	<p>Our affect objective was to “By the 10th of June 2023, we aim to create a campaign that promotes a sense of calm and balance in our target audience and maintains a community where followers can interact. To measure this, we want to achieve an average of 2 shared posts on both Instagram and Facebook.” If you take a look at the pictures shared above you can see that in the duration of this redo 0 posts have been shared on Facebook and Instagram. We suspect that the most important reasons for this are the following. For the other PRJ4 groups the projects might have ended for them. As we are followed by a lot of accounts from other groups it is likely that those are not active anymore. Making them unaware of what we are doing thus unable to support and share our posts. As for our followers that are in our target audience they are not as likely to share our posts as we are not a “real” brand and they do not want to confuse their friends and family with promoting a company that does not exist.</p>
		<h5 id="marketing-2">Learning points: What did you learn?</h5>
			<p>Throughout starting Unbeak we learned a lot about making a social media campaign. From the earlier section, promotional activities, we can see that our Facebook campaign failed as 0 of our posts got any likes or followers. As our team is all not active on Facebook we learned to see the importance of researching the platform you will be promoting on. As a brand It’s important to know who is to be found on which platform? In this case our target audience was abundantly active on Facebook but because we did not have the proper knowledge about the platform, being non-users of Facebook, this ultimately leaded to no progress on that specific platform. We did not know how to connect with that target audience using Facebook and the marketing tools it offers such as advertisements. We also asked ourselves the question: what works best for our target audience? We first used a more illustrated style of creating content with this we tried to connect the parents to what type of content they see made for their kids. Against our expectations this did not work as it was seen as childish. From feedback we learned that a more mature and modern style of promoting was more appreciated within our target audience. Therefore, we switched our style up. Unfortunately, did not help us reach more people from within our target audience. As our results were extremely low it is not possible to say if the look and feel of the content was the main reason. Researching this is something to keep in mind for the future recommendations.</p>
		  	<p>Something we also realized is that parents who are already struggling with time, stress and sleep management are not interested in spending their precious time on a brand that does not actually exist. This makes the project inherently more tough as we are already dealing with a lot of competition while also not having the ability to stand out because we don’t actually offer a good or service. Which is something we have learned is necessary for the consumer, no matter how good your content and values are. </p>
		  	<p>Besides this our Instagram reach insights show us that the posts with popular hashtags reached significantly more people. This teaches us that finding the right hashtag is truly important. </p>
		  	<p>Unfortunately, we did not reach any of our objectives. We have learned that for a brand to gain followers more than just posting is needed. A brand needs to actively reach out to their target audience instead of hoping that the target audience will just find them. We learned the importance of making diverse content. The competition with other brands is high so we need to stay flexible. As brand we can improve and expand our promotional activities. In order to do so we need to learn more about our target audience. Creating a powerful campaign helps us to grow as a brand. </p>
		  	<p>Our social media campaign had a four-week gap. In that time, we lost the support of our followers and after that, we reached significantly less people. This teaches us that consistency is extremely important. However, we discovered that both Instagram and Facebook have the option to schedule post. Due to this, almost all our post, contrary to the previous campaign were posted on time. Using this really worked and also clearly dividing who had the responsibility to poste, design, and make the caption helped us. </p>
		  	<p>From previous feedback we learned that using only animation/illustration style post is often perceived as childish, which does not suit our target audience. We expected that slightly changing the style of our posts to something that is more mature would attract more people of our target audience. However, we were unfortunately unable to reach them. It is not sure if the content that was post was the problem.</p>
		<h4 id="marketing-3">Future planning </h4>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What would you have done differently in the future (if this project would have continued)?</strong></h6>
		  <p>As mentioned in the learning points we did not achieve our objectives. Reflecting on this there are a couple of reasons for this. We struggled to find people from within our target audience. The people from within our target audience are all found trough our interviews. From our interviews we collected that they all have priorities more important than sharing our project, their time is simply too precious. After a four-week gap in the project we lost a large part of our reach and followers as the accounts that followed and support us before are most likely inactive. If the project were to continue we would start creating a budget for advertisements on Instagram. This way we can have greater reach and try to connect with parents that are not directly associated with the founders of Unbeak. We would also start on sending out sample to the already engaged consumers to try and convince them Unbeak is worth their time to share with others.</p>
		  <p>Another important point of reflection is that our Facebook campaign completely failed. As mentioned in the learning points. The only followers were members from our team and for each post we got 0 likes and 0 comments. It is clear that the team was not an expert in creating content that works for Facebook. It might be useful to reevaluate if Facebook is a proper platform for our campaign.</p>
		  <h6><strong>Future recommendations</strong></h6>
		  <p>As mentioned before it is recommended that Unbeak does more research into what kind of content our target audience wants to see and on which platforms. While doing this Unbeak needs to learn more about not only making a social media campaign but also about other forms of marketing. Questions like: how do we turn non followers into followers? And how do you balance online, and offline marketing are important to ask ourselves To Do this will prepare us for the changing preferences of our audience as they develop rapidly. </p>
		  <p>Being flexible will help us stay ahead of the game. The competition of start-up brands is huge as many new brands pop-up every day. Unbeak is recommended to always be willing to adapt to what our customers want.</p>
		  <p>It has been mentioned before that we cannot expect our target audience to run towards us. Instead, we need to reach out to them. We need to be where they already are. As an idea we could collaborate with self-awareness apps and organizations. This would help us spread the name of our brand and get people familiar with Unbeak. </p>
		  <h6><strong>What we would do different next time</strong></h6>
		  <p>Making sure your brand is visible on many platforms is vital to ensure success. Although other social media channels besides Facebook and Instagram might not yield as many results, it is still worth or time as it increases brand engagement and reach. Therefore, next time we would look more into different social media channels such as TikTok and Pinterest.</p>
		  <p>Next time, starting a similar project we would spend more time making different forms of content. As now, we only made Instagram posts with captions and posted the same content on Facebook. However, our target audience mentioned to like funny and informal content. We could use this to make funny videos from behind the screens of a starting brand such as Unbeak. We could make reels and TikTok videos that are easy and fun to share with friends and family. Doing this lets the people that already like our brand spread the word about Unbeak.</p>
		  <p>Next time we would also spend more time working on offline marketing as a significant part of our target audience is not very often found online.  </p>
		  <p>Working in a group and creating the marketing campaign overall went pretty solid. However, next time we thought it would be useful to spend more time brainstorming about the campaign with the whole instead of giving guidance about what kind of post need to be made and letting one person do the rest. This will hopefully result in a more create campaign with more variety. </p>
		  <p>Lastly, our brand Unbeak has three values: Balance, equanimity, and vulnerability. All of these are related to (mental)health and wellness. It is a shame that we barely used this within our marketing. Therefore, next time we would use this more. For instance, we could give tips trough posts and reel and we could even host (online)workshops. This helps us to create more value to Unbeak then just a brand that sells tea.</p>

"Some people drink protein shakes after their workout, I drink Unbeak."

As a personal trainer, my days are filled with high-intensity workouts and pushing myself to the limit. But when it comes to unwinding after a challenging session, Unbeak has become my go-to companion. It's like a moment of pure bliss, where the world fades away, and I can fully relax and recharge. The gentle warmth and comforting aroma of their teas become my reward, a treat for both body and soul.

But Unbeak isn't just my post-workout delight; it has become an integral part of my camping adventures as well. As a lover of the great outdoors, I never embark on a camping trip without a stash of Unbeak teas.

Thank you, Unbeak, for crafting teas that fuel my active lifestyle and bring me joy wherever my adventures take me. It's more than a beverage; it's a testament to the power of simple pleasures and the beauty of nature.

#Unbeak #RavingReview #ActiveLifestyle #CampingAdventure #FindYourBliss <br><br> As mentioned, we want to show that Unbeak can be useful for everyone. With this post we show another completely different customer that is very happy about what Unbeak has done for him.</p>

        <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas 4</h4>

        <p>Here you will find the content of the PRJ4 Management re-do. <strong>You can find the full canvas used during the original hand-i as well as the other 3 at the bottom of this page in the appendix.</strong></p>

        <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not enough sleep due to the stress and obligations of daily life. Think of work, kids, family, friend.</li>
          <li>Not enough time for their partner due to having to juggle all the other aspects of life. This causes people to neglect their partner.</li>
		  <li>Having kids is expensive. Children cost a lot of money, from buying clothes and food to buying them presents.</li>
		  <li>Existing alternatives for these problems are: creating a healthy diet and getting exercise; self-care, and mindfulness exercises; Drinking calming and stress-relieving beverages such as tea, Famous competition includes: Harney & Sons;  the Qi flower tea; Mighty Leaf tea; Twinings; Pukka; Lipton; Pickwick.</li>
		  <li>Other exisiting alternatives are creating more time for each other and communicating about feelings; Creating a budget and purchasing only what is necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
        <p>As mentioned, our Target audience, parents with young children have three main problems: sleep, time, and money, so we found out from the problem interviews. The reality is, there are only 24 hours in a day and money does not grow from a tree. The moment you have children you have responsibility over another life, fortunately, most parents take this very seriously. Therefore, sacrifices are undeniable, and our problem interviews show us that they are glad to make them. We came up with a solution that is simple because good things don’t always have to take time. The busy life of parents is often already so complicated. We believe that we should not overcomplicate the solution, therefore, simple is best. Our solution is herbal tea to help you sleep, relax, or get energized. The message behind this is to create a moment for yourself, it doesn’t have to be long as our audience does not have all the time in the world. However, it puts the focus on them, on what they find important. Besides this, the herbs in our tea can help them with problems such as sleep. Many parents mentioned that often the only time they have for themselves is when the kids are sleeping. They almost always use these moments to sit on the couch and watch tv. A cup of tea fits this moment perfectly. The reason Unbeak works for parents is that it is simple, easy to incorporate into a daily routine, is relatively cheap, and can help parents with feeling calm, and balanced, and get a good night's sleep.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>

She does this together with her husband with whom she tries to maintain a healthy relationship by opening up and communicating feelings. In her job as a cloud engineer, she strives to be successful in her work field.  Jessica loves to feel needed, and will always help others when they need her.

		  <li>The funding we receive, On our website it is possible to donate to our brand and help us fund our operations. This number will indicate whether our audience is interested in helping. If it turns out they are not, we can re-evaluate how to gain funding. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 2 revenue streams, customers, and investors.</li>
		  <li>Customers: They both always pay money.  Customers pay for the tea, this will be €9,90 for 100 grams or €2,49 for a try-out pack. They directly through our website.</li>
		  <li>Investors: Pay in different tiers and in return get a free try-out pack, a free tea egg shaped like Benny (our mascot), and a 10% discount on their orders for the rest of their life. They pay directly through our website.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: Hosting costs platform, marketing costs</li>
          <li>Variable: Distribution costs, Manufacturing costs</li>
        </ul>
		<p class="fw-bold">Cost per Unit</p>
	    All cost to produce and package <strong>1000 kilos of tea:</strong>
	<ul>
		  <li>€25,000 (Labor costs)</li>
			<li>€10,000 (Cost raw materials) </li>
			<li>€3,000 (cost tin cans) </li>
			<li>€1,000 (packaging costs) </li>
			<li><strong>Total costs: €39,000</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Cost per unit = Total costs / Total units produced =	€39,000 / 10,000 =	€3,9 </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reflection on the choices we made.
			First of all, our name: Unbeak. Unbeak incorporates the word beak as it represents a duck, in our logo the a in unbeak is shaped like the foot of a duck. In nature the duck symbolizes balance. Therefore, we wanted to incorporate something of the duck in our name and logo since balance is one of our core values. The colors of our brand are yellow and orange which are the colors of cartoon ducks, and blue which adds a nice contrast.
		</li>
        </ul>

		  <li>The existing alternatives that we found were: creating a healthy diet and getting exercise; Tea helps create that healthy diet but it is not the main focus of our brand, and getting exercise is nice, but our target audience is already short on their time, so it would be hard to find time to exercise.</li>
			<li>Self-care, and mindfulness exercises; With our tea, we encourage you to take some time for yourself, which is self-care. Mindfulness can be helpful, but people often find meditation difficult to do, we offer a solution that is easily accessible.Drinking calming and stress-relieving beverages such as tea, Famous competition includes: Harney & Sons;  the Qi flower tea; Mighty Leaf tea; Twinings; Pukka; Lipton; Pickwick.</li>
			<li>Creating more time for each other and communicating about feelings; Creating time for your partner is very important, but can you really be there for the other if you cannot even be there for yourself? The first step is taking care of yourself, only them you can help others. Creating a budget and purchasing only what is necessary. Creating this budget is important for parents who struggle with money, but from our interviews, we gathered that more parents struggle with finding time for themselves. That is the biggest problem we encountered, and therefore the problem we are giving a solution for.</li>			
		</ul>
		<p class="fw-bold">Pivots by Solution Interview:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Customer need pivot</strong><br>A potential problem we noticed from the interviews is that the style and layout of our brand look very child-like as if it is catered to children. This can be solved by changing the layout of our brand, focusing more on adults leaving most of the illustrations behind. </li>
			<li><strong>Business architecture pivot</strong><br>From the interviews, we also gathered that an additional product of a tea egg would be very nice. Our brand mascot is an illustrated duck called Benny. This duck is a little child-like but we can create a tea egg shaped like Benny who is floating on the surface of the tea. Since we offer loose-leaf tea, this also creates a nice product to use our tea with.</li>
		</ol>
		<h5 class="pt-3">Price per unit explained</h5>
		<p class="pt-2"><strong>Numbers used are based on industry knowledge and  assumptions as we did not have time to approach manufactures 1 by 1 to figure  out the exact pricing. We are calculating the price for 1000 kilos of tea and  packaging it per units of 100 grams.</strong>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Labor expenses: Labor expenses are crucial to the  manufacture of tea. Pay and labor-intensive procedures, including picking and  preparing tea leaves, can raise the cost of manufacturing overall.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The labor cost per hour will depend on the region and  prevailing wage rates. For illustration purposes, let's assume an average labor  cost of €10 per hour.&nbsp; <br>
          Total Labor Cost = Labor hours * Labor cost per hour  Total Labor Cost * amount of employees = 250 hours * €10 per hour * 10 =  €25,000&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Costs of Raw Materials: The price of tea leaves is a  significant factor in the cost of production. The quality of different tea  varieties varies, and pricing might change depending on supply and demand  factors.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>To calculate the total raw materials cost for 1000  kilos of tea, we multiply the average cost per kilogram by the total weight:&nbsp; <br>
          Total Raw Materials Cost = Average Cost per Kilogram *  Total Weight Total Raw Materials Cost = €10/kg * 1000 kg = €10,000&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The cost of tin cans can range from approximately  €0.10 to €0.50 per can, depending on the size, quality, and quantity ordered.  Assuming an average cost of €0.30 per tin can, the total cost of tin cans for  1000 kilos (1,000,000 grams) of tea would be:&nbsp; <br>
          Total Cost of Tin Cans = Number of Cans * Cost per Can  Total Cost of Tin Cans = 10,000 cans * €0.30 per can = €3,000&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Packaging and Transportation: Transporting tea from  the area of production to distribution hubs or export markets requires  packaging the commodity. The landed production cost includes expenses for  labeling, storage, shipping, and packaging supplies.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The cost of packaging materials such as inner liners  or pouches and labels can vary widely depending on the type, quality, and  quantity required. Assuming an average cost of €0.10 per unit, the total cost  would be:&nbsp; <br>
          Total Cost of Packaging Materials and Labeling =  Amount of units * Cost per unit of Packaging = 10,000 * €0.10 per gram = €1000&nbsp; </p>
