            <h5>Our color pallet</h5>

                <em>We chose a light color blue because this has a calming effect on one’s mind, this links to one of

                <em>The warm yellow color contrasts the blue making our color palette balanced, another one of Unbeaks

            <h5>Font choices</h5>
          </li>
          <p>The font styles Josefin Sans Bold and Mulish are ideal for the Unbeak brand. A contemporary, geometric
            sans-serif font named Josefin Sans Bold symbolizes the balance that Unbeak stands for. Mulish is a warm and
            inviting script typeface that emphasizes equanimity and vulnerability, which is a theme of Unbeak. Combined,
            the two fonts produce a balance between classic and contemporary lettering that perfectly captures the
            essence of the Unbeak brand</p>

        <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
        <p>To test our website we did one round of testing. This round included 3 partcipants who were given a number of questions and tasks. <strong>Testing evidence can be found in the appendix at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>
        <h5>Questions & Tasks</h5>
		<ul>
			<li> Try to donate to Unbeak</li>
			<li> Try to find our vison and our values </li> 
			<li>Try to find our privacy policy</li>
			<li>What do you think of the colors used?</li>
			<li>Is the layout appealing to you?</li>
			<li>Does the design of the website help persuade you into funding this brand?</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Test Results</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Our test participants had no trouble finding the option to donate. Putting it that big on the home page worked out really well. </li>
			<li>Finding our vision and values was also very easy. One participant went to the visual identity page first, because she associated the word ‘brand value’ with identity.</li>
			<li>Finding our privacy took a bit longer because our participants had to scroll down to the footer to find it but nobody clicked on the wrong thing.</li>
			<li>We received very mixed feedback from our participants concerning our colors. All participants thought our colors were soft, bright, happy but not all participants felt intrigued by them or thought they fit the image of a tea company. Something we realized during testing is that our participants do noy link the visual identity to the brand, they link it to the product and type of product. This resulted in multiple test participants not liking the colors we used because it did not represent a style that they consider to be right for a tea company. </li>
			<li>When looking at our layout we only had one participant who thought there was too much text. All other participants were very pleased by the layout.<i>‘I like the layout of the website. My attention was immediately grabbed by the quote and the “HEY” on the first page. The website is easy to navigate. On your first page it becomes immediately clear to me what Unbeak is about. Without having to read a whole bookwork. The layout is also very consistent, which I like.’</i> This is what one of our test participants had to say about the layout.</li>
			<li>Overall our test participants were not convinced enough to invest/donate to Unbeak. This mostly had to do with the fact that they thought the brand felt too childish. We are trying to create a moment for parents to stop for a second and drink some tea, so some of our participants thought it should have a more adult look to target those parents.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Future Actions</h5>
		<p>We as Unbeak were very happy with our test results as all of our participants were able to find the needed information in time. We did realize that not everybody is a fan of our visual identity, but after long consideration we have decided to stick with what we have since we feel like the current identity connects very well with our values. For future action we are looking at actually creating the customization page because we haven’t done much with it (which was intentional) and that confused some of our participants. We also changed the amount of text on all pages and it has been significantly reduced based on feedback from one of our participants.</p>

        <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

        <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
        <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
        <p>The goal of the campaign is to introduce our brand Unbeak to our main target group, and to share our values &
          mission with them. We want our main target group to invest in our brand through our website.</p>
        <p>The message we want to send to the world is: In world where people are chased by the clock in their attempt
          of always taking care of others. We believe that taking care of yourself first and spending time alone is an
          absolute must. Only then the clock won’t chase you and you’ll be able to be there for the ones you love.
          Promotional activities will include social media promotion. Posting regularly and creating a community is the
          main activity this campaign is based around.</p>
        <p>Our current objectives are: <br>
          <strong>Reach:</strong> Website 300 people before 10th of April. Instagram, 300 people have seen the page,
          Facebook, 200 people have seen the page.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Affect:</strong> We want our target audience (parents) to feel calm, balanced, and are able to take
          care of themselves just as well as of others. </p>
        <p> <strong>Response:</strong> We want our target audience (parents) to take care of themselves and be able to
          find balance so that they can take care of others too.</p>
        <h5>Our chosen channels are:</h5>
        <strong>Facebook:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>During our interviews we noticed that Facebook was a commonly used platform by our main target group</li>
          <li>We will be posting 3 times a week on this platform because based on our interviews we noticed this is how
            often our main target group uses this platform</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Instagram:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>During our interviews we noticed that Instagram was a commonly used platform by our main target group</li>
          <li>We will be posting 3 times a week on this platform because based on our interviews we noticed this is how
