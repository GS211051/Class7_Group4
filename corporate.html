            <h5>Our color pallet</h5>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
              <li>
                <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #9EC4E6;"></span>

                <em>We chose a light color blue because this has a calming effect on one’s mind, this links to one of
                  our values: Equanimity.</em>

                <em>The warm yellow color contrasts the blue making our color palette balanced, another one of Unbeaks

            <h5>Font choices</h5>
          </li>
		  </ul>
          <p>The font styles Josefin Sans Bold and Mulish are ideal for the Unbeak brand. A contemporary, geometric
            sans-serif font named Josefin Sans Bold symbolizes the balance that Unbeak stands for. Mulish is a warm and
            inviting script typeface that emphasizes equanimity and vulnerability, which is a theme of Unbeak. Combined,
            the two fonts produce a balance between classic and contemporary lettering that perfectly captures the
            essence of the Unbeak brand</p>

        <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
        <p>To test our website we did one round of testing. This round included 3 partcipants who were given a number of questions and tasks. <strong>Testing evidence can be found in the appendix at the bottom of this page.</strong></p>
        <h5>Questions & Tasks</h5>
		<ul>
			<li> Try to donate to Unbeak</li>
			<li> Try to find our vison and our values </li> 
			<li>Try to find our privacy policy</li>
			<li>What do you think of the colors used?</li>
			<li>Is the layout appealing to you?</li>
			<li>Does the design of the website help persuade you into funding this brand?</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Test Results</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Our test participants had no trouble finding the option to donate. Putting it that big on the home page worked out really well.</li>
			<li>Finding our vision and values was also very easy. One participant went to the visual identity page first, because she associated the word ‘brand value’ with identity.</li>
			<li>Finding our privacy took a bit longer because our participants had to scroll down to the footer to find it but nobody clicked on the wrong thing.</li>
			<li>We received very mixed feedback from our participants concerning our colors. All participants thought our colors were soft, bright, happy but not all participants felt intrigued by them or thought they fit the image of a tea company. Something we realized during testing is that our participants do noy link the visual identity to the brand, they link it to the product and type of product. This resulted in multiple test participants not liking the colors we used because it did not represent a style that they consider to be right for a tea company. </li>
			<li>When looking at our layout we only had one participant who thought there was too much text. All other participants were very pleased by the layout.<i>‘I like the layout of the website. My attention was immediately grabbed by the quote and the “HEY” on the first page. The website is easy to navigate. On your first page it becomes immediately clear to me what Unbeak is about. Without having to read a whole bookwork. The layout is also very consistent, which I like.’</i> This is what one of our test participants had to say about the layout.</li>
			<li>Overall our test participants were not convinced enough to invest/donate to Unbeak. This mostly had to do with the fact that they thought the brand felt too childish. We are trying to create a moment for parents to stop for a second and drink some tea, so some of our participants thought it should have a more adult look to target those parents.</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Future Actions</h5>
		<p>We as Unbeak were very happy with our test results as all of our participants were able to find the needed information in time. We did realize that not everybody is a fan of our visual identity, but after long consideration we have decided to stick with what we have since we feel like the current identity connects very well with our values. For future action we are looking at actually creating the customization page because we haven’t done much with it (which was intentional) and that confused some of our participants. We also changed the amount of text on all pages and it has been significantly reduced based on feedback from one of our participants.</p>

        <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

        <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
		  <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		  <p>Our current objectives are:</p>
          <p><strong>Reach:</strong> By the 10th of April, we want to reach 300 people to have seen our page on Instagram and 200 people to have seen our page on Facebook.</p>
        <p><strong>Affect:</strong> We want our target audience to feel calm and balanced. We want to create a community where our followers can interact with each other. By the 10th of  April, we want to reach an average of three shared posts on every Instagram and Facebook post.</p>
        <p class="mb-1"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
		<ul class="pb-3">
			<li>By the 10th of April 2023, we want to have 10 likes on average on every Instagram and Facebook post.</li>
			<li>By the 10th of April 2023, we want to have an average of three comments on every Instagram and Facebook post.  </li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Target audience: Parents with young children</h5>
			<p>Our target audience is parents with young children located in the south of the Netherlands. Therefore, we have decided to specify to parents with children between the ages of two and eight years old. We kept in mind that having kids is very expensive and that most parents have a part/full-time job to maintain. What we realized during our problem interviews is that having enough time for themselves. Instead, they are busy spending time with their kids, building a career, and maintaining a relationship with their partner is their main struggle. Or in the case of separated parents, date to find a new partner.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>At What time is our target audience on social media?</strong></h6>
		 	<p>In our problem interviews, we noticed that during the week they do not have time to be on their phones. In the morning, they are busy to get their kids ready and bring them to school. And during the day a larger amount of our target audience are working. They only have time for themselves in the evening because their children are in bed at that point. This means that we are posting in the evenings at 19.00 when they have eaten.</p>
		  	<p>On the weekend it is the opposite. People we interviewed said that they have time for themselves in the morning. Most interviewees stated that they play with their kids then. In the afternoon they are occupied. This is why we decided to post at 11.00 on Saturdays. We feel like this is a good middle-ground.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Which platforms are our target audience using, for how long, and what do we want to communicate?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>The interviewees stated that they are mostly on Facebook and Instagram between thirty minutes and 1,5 hours on Saturdays and during weekdays. The interviewees stated that they scroll through the app until they find something that grabs their attention. This is an ‘out-of-the-ordinary image’ or bright colors. Our brand wants to communicate being balanced, having equanimity, and being vulnerable. This means that we have decided on colors that stood out but still represent our brand. We chose the light color blue to create a calming effect on one’s mind, a warm yellow color contrasts the blue making our color palette balanced, and orange encourages social communication and represents the youthful spirit in Unbeak.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What is the activity on the app?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>On Instagram and Facebook, some of our interviewees use the app so that they can stay updated with family and friends. When they were active on the app, they were focused on posts of people that they know. Other interviewees also stated that they use the apps so that they can see aesthetically pleasing content. Meaning, fashion-related, online shopping, creative, and arts & crafts content. What was noticeable, is that on Facebook quoted ‘silly’ content is also popular within our target group. What they meant by this is memes, funny videos, etc.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What brands does our target audience like?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>The brands they prefer vary per person. One person was into fashion and followed brands like Zara. This, for us, means that we have to rely on our posting moments, in the evenings at 19.00.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Persona reflection based on the road map</strong></h6>
		  	<img class="img-fluid pb-5" src="images/unbeakmarketing3.jpg" alt="Unbeak brand roadmap">
		  <div class="row">
		  	<img class="col-6 img-fluid" src="images/unbeakpersona_Pagina_1.png" alt="Unbeak persona">
			<img class="col-6 img-fluid" src="images/unbeakpersona_Pagina_2.png" alt="Unbeak persona">
			<p>Our persona is based on our problem interviews. The main issue for parents with young children is a lack of time. Therefore, we wanted to create a moment that can help our audience find the balance needed to provide for others too.</p>
		  </div>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>How we are positioning our message.</strong></h6>
		  	<p>From our problem interviews we gathered that our target audience prefers to be approached in an informal way. Other reasons why we used informal communication are:</p>
		  <ol>
			  <li><strong>Relatability</strong>: An informal communication can help make our message more relatable to the target audience. By using everyday language, we can connect with our audience on a more personal level and create a sense of familiarity.</li>
			  <li><strong>Authenticity</strong>: An informal approach can also help to convey authenticity and honesty. Using a more conversational tone can help to make us seem more genuine and approachable, which can build trust with our audience.</li>
			  <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: An informal style of communication can make your message more accessible to a wider range of people. By using language that is easy to understand and avoiding complex jargon, we can make our message more inclusive and understandable to a wider audience.</li>
			  <li><strong>Engagement</strong>: An informal tone can help to keep our audience engaged and interested in our message. By using a conversational style, we can create better dynamic and interactive communication with them, which can help to hold our audience's attention.</li>
		  </ol>
		  	<p>How this looks in practice on our social media is by having a caption that has a meaning, is connected to our brand, and makes it relatable to our target audience.  </p>
		  	<img src="images/unbeakmarketing1.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="unbeak social media caption">
		  	<p>Example:<br>Caption is underneath the post of our tea flavor introduction. Here, we inform them about our flavors, give them the option to make their own tea, and remind them to check their email.  </p>
		  	<p>With this, we connect the audience in a sense that it is relatable and accessible. To make it authentic we created our own visuals and also created a mascot, Benny the Duck. He is a returning character in our posts. When they will see Benny, they will immediately think of Unbeak.</p>
		 <h5>Media tactics</h5>
		  	<p>Out of our problem interviews with our target audience, we noticed that our target audience is mainly positioned on Instagram and Facebook. This is the reason why we are using Instagram and Facebook to promote Unbeak.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Why are we using Instagram?</strong></h6>
		  	<p>Instagram’s’ use is focused on visual content. This means that we can showcase our brands’ images and videos to our audience. Doing this creates a social connection with our audience. Many brands and businesses have a strong presence on Instagram, which means that users can stay up-to-date with their favorite brands and discover new ones. And due to our unique style, they can also discover ours.</p>
		  	<p>A clear strength of Instagram is that it has a powerful algorithm that can help users find new content and accounts and find them relatable. This is helpful for us to create our community.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>Why are we using Facebook?</strong></h6>		  
		  	<p>The reason our target audience has Facebook is that they want to stay up-to-date with their social connection, networking purposes, and entertainment purposes. Like (news) articles, videos, games, and research products or services.</p>
		  	<p>A clear strength of Facebook is that the various reasons/ purposes to use the app are attractive to our audience according to our interviewees. This means that we have many ways to approach and position our brand through the app.</p>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What is our goal in promoting Unbeak? </strong></h6>
		  	<p>Our goals are for people to donate/Invest in us, promote the importance of self-care, and create a community that serves as a safe space.</p>
		  	<p>We want people to donate/invest in us so that we can provide herbal tea that has a reaction to their system to help them either get relaxed, energized, or sleepy.</p>
		  	<p>With Unbeak we want to promote the importance of self-care to our audience. Mainly parents with young children. However, the more people know about our brand, the better. The goal of Unbeak is to help people find balance in their busy schedules.</p>
		  	<p>By informing people about self-care and prioritization, we want to create a community that people can call a safe space. By creating this, we have an audience that follows every move we make.</p>
		 <h5>Planning: Content calendar</h5>
		  	<img src="images/unbeakmarketing2.png" class="img-fluid marketing-planning" alt="unbeak social media shedule">
		  	<p>We created the accounts on Wednesday the 15th of March. Due to this, we started posting on a Wednesday.</p>
		  	<p class="mb-1">From our interviews. we gathered the following about time of posting:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>The time that our target audience is on our chosen platforms, on a weekday, is during the evenings, after dinner. This is why we post at 19.00 in the evening.</li>
			<li>We picked Tuesday and Thursday because we wanted to have a day between every post so that when people see our post, it stands out.  </li>
			<li>Our interviewees stated that they mostly have plans on Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons & evenings. We wanted to avoid this time of the day, so we build around the target audience's general schedule. This is also why we post on Saturday mornings at 11.00.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p class="mb-1">Content being posted:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>On Tuesdays, we wanted to use these days to inform and introduce our brand to our potential audience.</li>
			<li>We decided to post our values every Thursday, but since we have three values and four weeks, we wanted to remind people to donate/invest. Since that is one of our main goals.</li>
			<li>On the weekend we want to promote our audience to rest from a busy week and remind them that it’s time for self-care. However, to go around the general target audience schedule.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p class="mb-1">Designer of the posts:  </p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>To have some diversity in design and to divide the work, we chose to have two designers. Between the two of them, they divided who designed what, so that the workload is divided equally.</li>
		  </ul>
		  	<p>We stop our social media activities on the 10th of April so that we have time to reflect. To see what did work and what did not, to see if we have reached our objectives, and to see what our main learning points are.</p>
		<h5 id="marketing-2">Learning points: What did you learn?</h5>
		  	<p class="mb-1">All group members participated in the making of our learning points and future planning.  </p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>It was difficult to first create a brand and then a product. Since I created a lot of the visuals, in the beginning, it took me longer to create them, and I didn’t have much experience with Illustrator. I never created a Lean canvas for management, that was fun. It is also fun to create a persona.</li>
			<li>This project leaned much more into creating a brand than I thought it would. I learned to use HTML and CSS the importance of a social media plan and how far you should think ahead, to first create a brand and then a product. I thought it was interesting. I am not sure if it is efficient. However, it is good to learn different perspectives. I would have started with production earlier since I had to learn HTML and CSS from scratch. Then the site would have been better than now.</li>
			<li>I learned the importance of dividing tasks, who was supposed to do the job, working with four people that have different perspectives, and creating a vision with four people which is quite difficult. It's hard to make every part connect (vision with the color palette and the mission, etc).</li>
			<li>I like copywriting better than I thought I would. And I learned how important hashtags are on social media. I also learned that it is more useful on Facebook to use long captions because parents read the entire text and our generation wouldn’t. that’s also why it is good to change the caption for Instagram.</li>
		  </ul>
		<h5 id="marketing-3">Future planning </h5>
		  <h6 class="pt-2"><strong>What would you have done differently in the future (if this project would have continued?  </strong></h6>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Gijs: I would like to have been more involved in programming, I do enjoy working on it more than I thought I would. If we have done that from the beginning, it would have made the project more cohesive.  </li>
			<li>Nienke: In the future, I would have created more content with people to make it more personal. For the product itself, offer more teas and offer tools for the tea. Add another color to our color palette. Visual Identity would have been stronger then. I also would have liked to introduce a gift bag. Create special holiday things. For example, Christmas or easter.</li>
			<li>Tara: I would have been online on more social media platforms. Due to time restraints, we didn’t have time to create as much as we wanted to. Also broadening our target audience to create more video ads, be present at events, make Benny (our mascot) into a stuffed animal, and Pre-schedule all posts.</li>
			<li>Julia: I would get more creative with our marketing strategies. Right now, it was very bland, due to lack of- and management of time. I would have liked it if we could have actually done an event where we can spread the message of Unbeak.</li>
		  </ul>

		  <li>Little devils are expensive. Children cost a lot of money, from clothes to food, buying them presents.</li>
		  <li>There are no existing alternatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>

        <ul>
          <li>We have a team member who is an expert on herbs.</li>
		  <li>We are a small team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The channels through which we reach our customers are the social media platforms <strong>Instagram</strong> and <strong>Facebook.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>

          <li>The number of sales we make</li>
		  <li>The number of social media followers we get</li> 
		  <li>The funding we receive</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 2 revenue streams, customers, and investors.</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: Hosting costs platform, marketing costs</li>
          <li>Variable: Distribution costs, Production costs</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Our product is tea, with herbs. We offer three pre-sets, A tea with herbs to help customers sleep and wake up well rested, a tea with herbs to help customers relax and stress less, and a tea with herbs to help customers get energized and focussed. We also offer the option to customize your own tea, so customers can make a mix of herbs to help them achieve their goals. By creating a moment to drink a cup of tea, customers are forced to take some time for themselves and create that balance between caring for others and their own needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
        <ul>
			<li>Not enough sleep: we correctly assumed that parents with young children do not get enough rest at night. Children tend to wake up a lot at night waking up their parents in the process.</li>
			<li>Not enough time for their partner: we correctly assumed that parents with young children do not have enough time for their partner. When you have a child, they become your number one priority instead of yourself or your partner.</li>
			<li>Children are expensive: we correctly assumed that parents with young children find it very expensive to maintain them. When you don’t have children parents can spend all the money they want without having to take care of anyone. Now they have to think hard about what they want to spend money on and also save money for the children. </li>
			
		</ul>
